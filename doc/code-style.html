    <h1>CODE STYLE</h1>

    <h2>Section 1. File extensions.</h2>

    .cpp - C++ code
    .c   - C code
    .h   - C/C++ header
    .pro - Project file

    <h2>Section 2. File names.</h2>

    We tend to keep the names of a class and the file it is defined in
    to be the same. It means, if we have a class MyClass then the file name
    will be MyClass.{cpp,h}

    <h2>Section 3. General.</h2>

    - We prefer a tab size equal to 4.
    - #ifndef instruction in a header should go like this:

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <code>
    #ifndef NS_MYCLASS_H
    #define NS_MYCLASS_H
    ...
    #endif // NS_MYCLASS_H
    </code>

    <h2>Section 4. Variable and function names.</h2>

    The name of a variable/function should be clear enough to find out
    the purpose of it. The name should start with a lower case letter. In
    case the name consists of several words all words but first one should
    start with an upper case letter.

    The following prefixes are used to recognize different kinds of variable:
    - "i" means the function's input parameter
    - "o" means the function's output parameter
    - "m" means the class data member
    - "g" means that the variable is global

    As for local variable they are not prefixed.

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <code>
    int localName;<br>
    void start();<br>
    void getFirstParent(T *ipSomeObject);<br>
    <br>
    class A<br>
    {<br>
    int mCount;<br>
    };<br>
    </code>

    <h2>Section 5. Formating functions.</h2>

    Any function should be formatted as follows:

    return_type
    [class_name::]functionName(parameters_list)

    If the parameters list is long enough and doesn't fit in a line ( let it
    be 80 characters), each paramater starting from the second on that list
    may be written on a separate line.

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <code>
    int
    doSomeAction(int ipFirstParam,
                 int ipSecondParam,
         ...
         int ipLastParam)
    </code>

    <h2>Section 6. Formatting classes.</h2>

    At any case each class member either function or data should have
    its type and name separated by a single space.

    The access sections of the class must appear in the following order:
    public, protected, private (two sections for functions and variables,
    variables are the first, functions are the last; see example).

    The rule for getters/setters names is that a setter for any member
    is prefixed with 'set' and getter is not.

    The order of getters/setters is: getter1, setter1, getter2, setter2,
    and so on.

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <code>
    /*
     * Comments about this class
     */
    class SomeClass {
    public:
        <declare variables here>
    public:
        <declare functions here>
        T value1() const;
        void setValue1(T ipParam);

        T value2() const;
        void setValue2(T ipParam);
        ...
    public slots:

    protected:
        <declare variables here>
    protected:
        <declare functions here>
    protected slots:

    private:
        <declare variables here>
    private:
        <declare functions here>
    private slots:

    signals:
    };
    </code>

    <h2>Section 7. Braces and parentheses.</h2>

    If a brace is an openning one for a class or a function, then it
    should go on the next line after that has class keyword or function
    signature.

    If a brace is an openning one for an if, for, switch, etc. then it
    should go on the same line as the corresponding keyword.

    An openning parantheses for a function's parameters list should not be
    separated from this function's name with a space character. However it
    should be seperated with a single space if it goes for an if, for,
    switch, etc., blocks.

    The expression inside the parantheses should not be separated from them
    with any space characters.

    The closing parantheses should be separated from the opening brace with
    a single space.

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <code>
    int someFunction(...);<br>
    <br>
    if (some_expr) {<br>
    ...<br>
    }<br>
    </code>

    <h2>Section 8. Long lines.</h2>

    If a line exceeds the width limit it should be broken into several
    parts. In case of a long if expression containing many sections between
    ||, &&, etc. a new line-part should start with a logical operator.

    <h2>Section 9. Switch block.</h2>

    The switch-block has to look like this

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <code>
    switch (some_var) {
    case EnumElementWithLongName:
    // (tabsize > 4) ? 1 tab : 2 tabs;
    case OtherCase:
    // some code
    default:
    // default code
    };
    </code>

    <h2>Section 10. Calling default constructor.</h2>

    Declaring a variable on stack should be as following:
    <code>A a;</code>
    Declaring a variable on heap should be as following:
    <code>A *a = new A();</code>

    <h2>Section 11. Enum items.</h2>

    If a class has the enum defined inside it, then the enum item (when
    used in code) should be prefixed with the class' name.

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <code>
    case Class::ItemName: .....
    </code>

    <h2>Section 12. Namespaces.</h2>

    Namespaces should take names of directories in the sources directory structure.
    When declaring a type in a header the namespace should be opened before declaration
    and closed after it. When defining the implementation in a source file the same
    approach is used.
    When using some type which is inside some namespace(s) the full name can be used if
    there is the only usage in a scope. If there are several usages of this type then
    "using NS;" should be used at the beginning of the scope where this type is being
    used.
    Note: avoid using global "using NS;".
